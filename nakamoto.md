##Bitcoin 

#### Digital Currency 
At the core of a digital currency is a simple ledger of all transactions. The result of which is the current balance of each account. A transaction is simply a message that instructs the ledger too debt from the sender address and credit the receiver address. This address is a public-key and, the transaction must be signed with the senders private key. 

When the protocol is decentralized, all user will have a copy of all transactions, and can verify the entire history. This will result in all nodes having the same balances for all addresses. For this to work, there must be consensus as to the current state of the ledger.  

#### Impossible 
We have known for decades, and there are scientific proofs that it is impossible to coordinate the exact information among multiple distant nodes without a central authority. In the case of currency, say a sender sends the same funds to two different addresses simultaneously, a double spend. 

Some of the nodes will credit the funds to one address and some of the nodes will credit a different address. From each nodes point of view, the transaction they have is perfectly valid. 

#### Blockchain 
On October 31 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto, published a paper with a practical solution to this impossible problem. All new transactions will be kept inside a block. Periodically the block will be sealed, and put on the end of a chain, creating a Blockchain. Nodes will only consider transactions contained inside the blocks to be valid. To reached consensus, all nodes must have an exact copy of each block. 

#### Proof of work 

For a block to be valid, and accepted by nodes, is must contain a Proof-of-Work. The Proof-of-Work is the digital equivalent of finding a needle in a haystack. At all times all nodes are searching for this needle, and once found the proof is shared, and the block is signed by the finder. When a node receives a block with a valid proof, it adds it to its blockchain, updates its ledger with the transactions in the new block, and then immediately starts looking for the next Proof-of-Work. 

This process is called "mining", and is incentivized by a block-reward. Each time a block is mined, the miner gets brand new minted Bitcoins added to his wallet. The protocol states that only the longest chain is the winner. This makes it impossible for someone to ignore the valid block, and continue looking for the proof to his alternative block. By the time he finds his proof, the network would already be proving the next block, and he can never catch-up. After 6 blocks, there is less than a .01% chance of an alternate chain catching up. 


#### Value 
Bitcoin has value, because it is unforgeable, has a limited supply, is fungible, and has utility of a currency. Unlike fiat, there is no central authority that can issue new currency. New coins can only get created through the process of mining, and is distributed to the miner who finds each block.

Traditional fantasy football, also know as Rotiserie, became prominant during the 90's internet boom. The game was designed to for players to mimic the role of an NFL General Manager and Coach. 

A typical league consists of 12 teams, a pre-season draft, head-t-head weekly matchups, a playoff and championship game played on week 16 of the NFL season. Each team puts money into the pot at the begining of the season, and league champion wins the pot at the end of the season.

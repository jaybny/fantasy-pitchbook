Traditional fantasy football, also know as Rotiserie, became prominent during the 90's internet boom. The game was designed for players to mimic the role of an NFL General Manager and Coach. 

###Season Long
A typical league consists of 12 teams, a pre-season draft, head-to-head weekly matchups, a playoff and championship game. The championship game is played during week 16 of the NFL season.  At the beginning of the season, each team puts an entry fee into the pot, and the league champion wins the pot at the end of the season. 

####Draft
Before week1 of the NFL season, a fantasy draft is held. The draft consists of 20 rounds, were each team selects one NFL player to his fantasy team in each round. Once a player is drafted he is owned by that team and cannot be drafted again. After the draft each team has a roster of 20 players.

####Weekly Matchups
Each fantasy team is matched up against another team during each week of the NFL season. The manager must submit a starting lineup from the players he owns. A starting lineup must consist of a quarterback, two running backs, two wide receivers, a tight end, kicker and team-defense. Your team earns fantasy points based on your players game statistics. A touchdown catch from your wide receiver will earn you 6 points, and a field goal from your kicker will earn you 3 points. The team with the most points gets a win added to his record, the other get a loss. 


####Waivers
Free Agents, NFL players not on any team can be acquired during a weekly waiver wire period. A blind bidding process is used, and the highest bid gets the player. There is a cap on the total amount each team can spend on free agents for the entire season.

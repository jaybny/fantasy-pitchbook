Daily fantasy sports (DFS), is a new take on traditional fantasy sports. It attempts to compress the season long model into a "daily" contest. DFS growth is being fuelled by former online poker players, since online poker has been banned in the US. 

###Weekly 
DFS websites provide weekly fantasy football contests. There are new weekly contest, from week1 of the NFL season though the playoffs and superbowl. Players join a bracket with anywhere from 2 to 20,000 others. Before the weekly NFL games begin, each player builds his fantasy team based on a salary cap. Entry fees range from .50 to $10,000. The payout structure ranges from winner take all, to equal distribution among the top 50%. 

####Salary Cap 
Weekly fantasy teams are constructed by selecting players from a pool of all NFL players. Each NFL player has a salary amount, which is loosely based on historical and projected performance. Teams must select a specific number of players from each position, and their total salaries must be at or below the cap. With salary caps, many teams will have the same player in his lineup. Unlike the draft in season long games, where each player is owned exclusively by a single team. 

####Payout
Just like season long games, your team earns fantasy points based on your players game statistics. A touchdown catch from your wide receiver will earn you 6 points, and a field goal from your kicker will earn you 3 points. After all NFL games are over for the week, each teams is ranked based on the total amount of fantasy points earned, and payouts are distributed to those with the most points.

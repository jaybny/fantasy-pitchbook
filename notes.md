How many of you here play daily fantasy sports? Ok, if you did try, learn all the rules,
you would probably not win, and you see Condie winning all the basketball contests and you would say.  

Why is it that the same guys win all the time on DraftKings.com? Im going to fix that. With satoshi fantasy we will reach global concensus and price discovery on each players projects, and in real time.. and in return for this information those of you with real fantasy football skills will be rewarded. 

Should I sit or start Jimmy Graham? 

Thank you to George Bush, for signing the gambling act

fantasybit is a gamified cryto token... the most innnovative part is the distribution model. 

in satoshi fantasy we dont need block rewards, Tom Brady, or Joe Montana playing football and scoring points is what generates the coinbase transaction. 

in satoshi fantsy we dont need miners proof work, instead we use fantsy football skills. in a proof-of-skill blockchain... 

and this is just the beginning, with price disocery, we just created the best damn fantasy football resource on the internet, 

fantasy players dont care at all about bitcoin, which is why we are designing a fantasy pass, 

this will be a hardware wallet and a smart phone case, with NFL branding, hopefully in time for father day. 

and we can thank George Bush, as well as Satoshi Nakamoto, (assuming they are different people)

im Jay Berg, the project is Satoshi Fantasy, your an angel investor. "

####Login
Using a login/password to access a web-site will be a thing of the past. Instead of relying on and trusting a central authority to grant you access, you will be granted access by providing a unique digital fingerprint. 

For thousands of years, it was unanimously agreed that the only way for two parties to establish secure communications was to first exchange a secret key of some kind. In 1976, Public Key Cryptography (PKC) was discovered , by splitting the secret key into two. Each key had the remarkable property that it was only able to decrypt messages that were encrypted by the other. The key used to encrypt the message could not be used to decrypt it. The enabled one key to be made pubic, and the other to remain private. You now had the ability of receiving fully secure secret messages from anyone who had your public key. 

When you flip this around, and you sign a message with your private-key, this means anyone can read it using your public-key. There is no secret communication here... its much better then that. It proves that you and only you, the one with the private-key, is the author of the message. 

This is your digital fingerprint. Pretty soon, when you want to gain access to a web site, you will provide your digital fingerprint, instead of a login/password. Your public key will be in the "phone book", and you will be responsible for your own identity, your private key. 

In the near future, if you want to change your "login" name, maybe all you would need to do is sign a message "My new name is BabeRuth". Depending on the consensus protocol, maybe the network will reject this name because its already taken. 

The identity is controlled by you. Your message is controlled by you. Its up to the decentralized general public to try to agree on how to respond to your messages. 

####Protocol
 A distributed decentralized consensus protocols is a set of rules, that must followed by everyone in the network. Anyone can send signed messages to the network. The message gets sent to each and every member of the network. Each member will validate the message and either accept or reject it. 
 
 As long as a majority of the members follow the rules, the protocol lives on. If a member decides to break the rules, they have just left the protocol and started their own "fork", causing no harm to the majority consensus.
